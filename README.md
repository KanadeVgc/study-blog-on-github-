          Understanding and Exploring 
          
      Hi, everyone I am Alvin Mak who come from Hong Kong studying Management Information System in NCCU.
I am going to share my study journey on this platform,Thank you for watching my study blog haha xd.
This article will share my learning progress with 8 parts which are my studying subjects.
The main point will focus on error concept and misunderstanding on each paragraph 
remember
" Improve from mistakes is the most important methods when you want to be the top "Player" "

Part 1 Programming Design (1) 

1.1 Lab 2 

In Lab2 Q1 1.1 , i need to set a Scanner to calculate variable Gap,Avg,Min and Multiple Value ,therefore calculate the random value on Q1.2.
In Lab2 Q2 ,i need to form my name with seperate first name and last name with the length of string on my program .

in this exercise i face a problem is i cannot calculate random value on the lab, however , i study the article on web and notes from lectuer ,
i understand one question , math method usage is wide , it's help me easily to form a equation on sout print .
The equation like 
}
//System.out.println("Random number between "+num1+" and "+num2+" : "+x);

x is from this equation.

// int x = 0;
   x = (int)(Math.random()*(num2-num1+1))+num1;

{

Secomdly, i learnt a String with subString concept in this lab.

if i wanna pick a letters on a string , for instance Alvin Mak 0=A M=6 ,the column of nothing is 5. 
so i can set a String [variable1] = "" 
and set a String [variable2]= "Alvin Mak" on code 
String v1 = v2.subString(x,x) then ok 
For example, i want pick a Mak come out , {Alvin }= 0 to 5 Therefore Mak is 678 
so (x,x) should be (6,8)

that's all . 

Part2 Assignment 1 

This assignment i learnt so much concept on it such as If Else statement, printf Method and "%.2f ,%s,%n" 

in the program create progress, i have some mistakes on it, 
1. forget if statement need }{ to form it
2. else doesn't have any statement but i formed 
3. if u wanna form a value with %.2f with printf method u can use "%.2f = %s "and on behind v1,s1,v2,v2
  it will form 20.0 TWD(s1) = 0.032x20(v2) EUR(v2)
4.if no use printf method? use Mathround and Mathpow For example = 
    //double bmi = Math.round((weight / Math.pow((height / 100), 2)) * 100.0) / 100.0;
   Thanks timmy hung and brian ng coaching in this project.
5.if input is String > NOOOO NextLine is Next()

That's all on this assignment review .
